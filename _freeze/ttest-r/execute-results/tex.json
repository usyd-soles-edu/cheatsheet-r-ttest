If your data is not already structured this way, reshape it manually in a spreadsheet program or in R using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package.\n\n\n::: {layout=\"[ 0.4, -0.1, 0.4 ]\" #fig-format}\n\n:::: {#first-column}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{lr}\n\\toprule\nSex & BW \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nF & 2.15 \\\\ \nM & 2.55 \\\\ \nF & 2.95 \\\\ \nF & 2.70 \\\\ \nM & 2.20 \\\\ \nF & 1.85 \\\\ \nM & 2.55 \\\\ \nM & 2.60 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {#second-column}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{rr}\n\\toprule\nF & M \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n2.15 & 2.55 \\\\ \n2.95 & 2.20 \\\\ \n2.70 & 2.55 \\\\ \n1.85 & 2.60 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nData should be in long format (left) where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. This is the preferred format for most statistical software. Wide format (right) is also common, but may require additional steps to analyse or visualise in some instances.\n::::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Data\nFor this cheatsheet we will use data from the possums dataset used in [BIOL2022](https://www.sydney.edu.au/units/BIOL2022) labs.\n\n\n\n\n{{< downloadthis possums.xlsx dname=\"possum\" label=\"possum.xlsx\" type=\"primary\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## About \nThe one-sample *t*-test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample $y$ is significantly different from a known or hypothesised population mean ($\\mu$). **Examples**:\n\n- Is the mean weight of canned tuna significantly different from what was stated on the label (400 g)?\n- Is the mean height of a sample of male students significantly different from the national average height (175.6 cm)? \n- Is the mean number of kittens in a litter significantly different from 4?\n\n## Modelling\n\n> Is the mean **body weight** of possums (`BW`) significantly different from 3.5 kg?\n\nThe [**simplified model**]{style=\"color:olive\"} for the mathematically-adverse individual is $$\\color{olive}\\text{body weight} \\sim 3.5$$ which translates to \"the body weight of possums is *around* 3.5 kg\".\nThe [**statistical model**]{style=\"color:red\"} is $$\\color{red}\\text{body weight} = \\beta_0 + \\epsilon$$ where $\\beta_0$ is the hypothesised population mean and $\\epsilon$ is the error term.\n\n### Preparing the data\nExtract **only** the variable of interest from the dataset using `select()` from the `dplyr` package – `BW`. Assign the variable to a new object -- `bw` in this case.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readxl)\npossums <- read_excel(\"possums.xlsx\", sheet = 2) # import\nbw <- select(possums, BW) # select variable\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYour own data should be in a similar format.\n\n## Analytical approaches\nThe traditional approach to the one-sample *t*-test is to use the `t.test()` function in R, while the modern approach is to use a general linear model (GLM) with the `lm()` or `glm()` functions.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## `t.test()` function\n\n### Methods reporting\n\n> A one-sample *t*-test was used to determine whether the mean body weight of possums was significantly different from 3.5 kg. This was computed using the `t.test()` function in R version 4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2024).\n\n### Perform the analysis\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(bw, mu = 3.5)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Check assumption(s)\n#### Normality\nAny combination of one or more of the following checks can be used to assess normality:\n\n- **Histogram**: `hist(bw$BW)`\n- **Q-Q plot**: `qqnorm(bw$BW)`\n- **Shapiro-Wilk test**: `shapiro.test(bw$BW)`\n\nInclude the appropriate description in your methods section.\n\n> The normality of body weight was assessed using [insert method(s)].\n\n### How to report results\n> The mean body weight of possums was significantly different from 3.5 kg (t~19~ = -10.3, 95% CI [2.3, 2.7], p < 0.001).\n\n## `lm()` function\n\n### Methods reporting\n> A general linear model was used to determine whether the mean body weight of possums was significantly different from 3.5 kg. This was computed using the `lm()` function in R version 4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2024).\n\n### Perform the analysis\n\nFor a one-sample *t*-test, the formula needs to be specified as `y - µ ~ 1` where `y` is the variable of interest and µ is the hypothesised value that is being tested. The `1` indicates that the model has an intercept only i.e. we are testing whether the mean difference is significantly different from 0.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit <- lm((BW - 3.5) ~ 1, data = bw)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Check assumption(s)\n#### Normality\n\nWith a GLM, normality can be assessed using the residuals of the model. The following checks can be used:\n\n- **Histogram**: `hist(residuals(fit))`\n- **Q-Q plot**: `qqnorm(residuals(fit))`\n- **Shapiro-Wilk test**: `shapiro.test(residuals(fit))`\n\n### How to report results\n\n> There is evidence to suggest that the mean body weight of possums was significantly different from 3.5 kg (GLM, t~19~ = -10.3, p < 0.001).\n\n:::\n\n## Exercise(s)\n\nDownload the penguins dataset (from below if you are reading this in HTML), or load the dataset from the `palmerpenguins` package. Perform a one-sample *t*-test to determine whether the mean flipper length of penguins is significantly different from 200 mm. \n\n\n\n\n{{< downloadthis penguins.csv dname=\"penguins\" label=\"penguins.csv\" type=\"primary\" >}}\n\n",
